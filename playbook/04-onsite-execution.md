# 04. Onsite Execution

## Goal

Maximize onsite conversations, capture qualified leads efficiently, and document next steps for every interaction.

## Booth strategy and flow

- Optimize booth layout for quick discovery and quiet discussions.
- Place high-value demos in visible zones with quick qualification prompts.
- Align staff roles: greeter, qualifier, demo lead, closer.

## Lead capture tools

- Use mobile lead capture apps or badge scanners.
- Standardize fields: role, buying stage, timeline, priority level.
- Capture notes in real time to avoid loss of context.

## Qualification framework

Use a fast 4-question filter:

1. What problem are you solving?
2. How are you handling it today?
3. What

 is your decision timeline?
4. Who else is involved in evaluation?

## Conversation structure

- 30-second hook: problem, proof, and relevance.
- 3-minute discovery: fit, urgency, and pain points.
- Clear next step: calendar invite or follow-up asset.

## Contact capture checklist

- Confirm name, role, email, and phone.
- Tag lead quality (A/B/C tier).
- Note relevant context and internal handoff.

## Deliverable

A structured lead capture dataset with qualification notes and next-step commitments.
