## Lead scoring and tiers

- **Tier A**: ICP match, budget, timeline, decision maker.
- **Tier B**: ICP match, long-term timeline.
- **Tier C**: low fit or unclear requirements.

## CRM and pipeline process

- Log all leads within 48 hours.
- Assign owner and stage.
- Add notes and last-touch date.
- Track conversions by lead source = event.

## ROI calculation template

**Core formula**

ROI = (Event-attributed revenue - Total event cost) / Total event cost

**Expanded model (recommended)**

1. Qualified leads = Total leads x Qualification rate
2. Opportunities = Qualified leads x Opportunity rate
3. Expected revenue = Opportunities x Average contract value x Win rate
4. ROI = (Expected revenue - Total event cost) / Total event cost

**Example**

- Total leads: 180
- Qualification rate: 20% => 36 qualified leads
- Opportunity rate: 30% => 10.8 opportunities
- ACV: $25,000
- Win rate: 25% => Expected revenue = 10.8 x 25,000 x 0.25 = $67,500
- Event cost: $45,000
- ROI = (67,500 - 45,000) / 45,000 = 0.5 (50%)

**Sensitivity check**

If win rate drops to 15%, expected revenue = 10.8 x 25,000 x 0.15 = $40,500, turning ROI negative. Use this to set minimum qualification and win-rate targets before committing budget.

## Deliverable

A cleaned, enriched CRM pipeline with attribution and documented ROI.
