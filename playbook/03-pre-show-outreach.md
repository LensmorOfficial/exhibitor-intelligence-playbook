## LinkedIn outreach strategy

- Send connection requests 2

4 weeks before the show.
- Personalize with event references and category signals.
- Use a 2-touch cadence: connection request

 + follow-up message.

## Scheduling best practices

- Offer 3-4 short meeting blocks per day.
- Keep 15-minute buffer between meetings.
- Prioritize high-value exhibitors during peak

 hours.

## Timing plan

- **T-6 weeks**: build target list, segment, and draft messaging.
- **T-4 weeks**: outreach wave #1.
- **T-2 weeks**: outreach wave #2 + schedule confirmations.
- **T-1 week**: finalize calendar and confirm meeting locations.

## Deliverable

A confirmed meeting calendar with high-value exhibitors and a prioritized walk-up target list.
