# 02. Exhibitor Profiling

## Goal

Build a standardized, data-driven view of exhibitors so teams can prioritize outreach and onsite conversations.

## Core data dimensions

- **Company basics**: legal name, domain, HQ, size, revenue band.
- **Industry and sub-vertical**: primary category and specialization.
- **Product lines**: key offerings, differentiation, pricing tier.
- **Buying signals**: funding, hiring, partnerships, expansion.
- **Tech stack**: integrations, vendor ecosystem, platforms used.
- **Decision makers**: titles likely attending or exhibiting.

## Exhibitor scoring model

Use a weighted score (0

100) based on:

- ICP fit (30%)
- Intent signals (25%)
- Strategic value (20%)
- Budget capacity (15%)
- Competitive overlap (10%)

> Example: Score = (ICP fit * 0.30) + (Intent * 0.25) + (Strategic * 0.20) + (Budget * 0.15) + (Overlap * 0.10)

## High-value exhibitor identification

- Top 20% of scores form the priority outreach list.
- Add a

100/high signal tier for onsite executive outreach.
- Flag partner or integration opportunities separately.

## Data enrichment and cleaning

- Use enrichment sources for domain, size, tech stack, and intent.
- Normalize titles and deduplicate contacts.
- Assign ownership and lifecycle stages for follow-up.

## Deliverable

A scored exhibitor master list with tiers, rationale, and recommended next actions.
