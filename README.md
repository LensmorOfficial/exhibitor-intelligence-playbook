> The complete playbook for B2B teams to maximize trade show ROI — from pre-show research to post-show conversion.

## Why this playbook

Trade shows are expensive, noisy, and full of distractions. Winning exhibitors treat events as a full-funnel program — from event selection and exhibitor profiling to pre-show outreach, onsite qualifying, and post-show conversion. This playbook provides a practical, step-by-step SOP designed for B2B sales and marketing teams who need repeatable, measurable outcomes.
